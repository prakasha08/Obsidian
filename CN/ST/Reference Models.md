## 🌐 Reference Models in Computer Networks

Reference models provide a **conceptual framework** for understanding and designing network systems. They help ensure **interoperability** among various hardware and software implementations.

### 📌 Why Reference Models?

- Different vendors used incompatible networking components.
    
- The **ISO (International Organization of Standardization)** introduced a standardized model to resolve compatibility issues and promote seamless communication.

### 🧩 What is a Reference Model?

A **Reference Model** defines:

- Standard **layers of functions** required for communication.
    
- **Roles and responsibilities** of each layer.
    
- A base for developing interoperable network systems.

### 📘 Two Primary Reference Models:

#### 1. OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model

- Developed by ISO.
    
- Contains **7 layers**:
    
    1. Physical
        
    2. Data Link
        
    3. Network
        
    4. Transport
        
    5. Session
        
    6. Presentation
        
    7. Application
        

Each layer has specific tasks, and layers interact only with their direct neighbors.

#### 2. TCP/IP Model

- Used practically across the internet.
    
- Contains **4 layers**:
    
    1. Network Access
        
    2. Internet
        
    3. Transport
        
    4. Application
