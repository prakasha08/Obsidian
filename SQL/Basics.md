### 1. `SELECT`

The `SELECT` statement retrieves specific columns or all columns (`*`) from a table.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees;
```

Selects only `name` and `salary` columns from the `employees` table.

**Selecting All Columns:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

This returns every column in the `employees` table.

### 2. `FROM`

The `FROM` clause specifies the table(s) where data should come from.

**Example with Multiple Tables (Joining):**

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees, departments
WHERE employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

Retrieves names of employees and department names, connecting data across two tables.

### 3. `AS`

`AS` creates an alias (temporary name) for columns or tables, simplifying readability.

**Example of Column Alias:**

```sql
SELECT name AS employee_name, salary AS monthly_salary FROM employees;
```

This renames the `name` column as `employee_name` and `salary` as `monthly_salary` in the results.

**Example of Table Alias:**

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name 
FROM employees AS e, departments AS d 
WHERE e.department_id = d.id;
```

This query uses `e` as an alias for `employees` and `d` for `departments`.

### 4. `DISTINCT`

`DISTINCT` removes duplicate rows in the result set for a specific column or combination of columns.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
```

Returns a unique list of departments without duplicates.

### 5. `AND`

`AND` combines conditions, ensuring all must be true.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30 AND department = 'Sales';
```

Returns employees who are both over 30 and in the Sales department.

### 6. `OR`

`OR` combines conditions where only one must be true.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age < 25 OR department = 'Marketing';
```

Returns employees who are either under 25 or in the Marketing department.

### 7. `NOT`

`NOT` negates a condition, selecting rows where the condition is false.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE NOT department = 'HR';
```

Returns employees who are not in the HR department.

### 8. `IN`

`IN` checks if a value matches any value in a list.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing', 'IT');
```

Returns employees working in either Sales, Marketing, or IT.

### üîπ `ANY` Operator

The `ANY` keyword compares a value to **any value in a list or subquery** ‚Äî meaning **"at least one"** must match the condition.

### ‚úÖ Syntax:

sql

CopyEdit

`<value> <operator> ANY (<subquery>)`

### ‚úÖ Meaning:

It returns `TRUE` if the comparison is `TRUE` **for at least one** value in the subquery.

### üìå Example 1: Using `ANY` with `>`

**Question**: Find employees who earn **more than at least one** employee in department 30.

sql

CopyEdit

`SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > ANY (     SELECT salary     FROM employees     WHERE department_id = 30 );`

üîç **What happens**:

- The subquery fetches all salaries in department 30.
    
- The outer query finds employees whose salary is **greater than at least one** of those salaries.
    

---

### üîπ `ALL` Operator

The `ALL` keyword compares a value to **every value** in a list or subquery ‚Äî meaning **"must satisfy the condition for all values"**.

#### ‚úÖ Syntax:

sql

CopyEdit

`<value> <operator> ALL (<subquery>)`

#### ‚úÖ Meaning:

It returns `TRUE` if the comparison is `TRUE` **for every** value in the subquery.

#### üìå Example 2: Using `ALL` with `>`

**Question**: Find employees who earn **more than every** employee in department 30.

sql

CopyEdit

`SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > ALL (     SELECT salary     FROM employees     WHERE department_id = 30 );`

üîç **What happens**:

- The subquery fetches all salaries in department 30.
    
- The outer query finds employees whose salary is **greater than the highest** salary from that list.
    

---

### üîÅ Comparison: `ANY` vs `ALL`

| Operator | Means‚Ä¶               | Returns TRUE if‚Ä¶                                     |
| -------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANY`    | At least one matches | **One or more** values in subquery satisfy condition |
| `ALL`    | All must match       | **Every** value in subquery satisfies condition      |

---

#### üìå More Examples

#### Using `= ANY` (same as `IN`)

sql

CopyEdit

`SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id = ANY (10, 20, 30);`

üî∏ This works like:

sql

CopyEdit

`WHERE department_id IN (10, 20, 30);`

---

#### Using `!= ALL` (not equal to all ‚Üí i.e., different from every value)

sql

CopyEdit

`SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id != ALL (10, 20, 30);`

üî∏ This means: department_id is **not equal to 10, 20, or 30** ‚Äî different from **every** listed value.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Note

- If the subquery returns **no rows**, then:
    
    - `x > ANY (empty)` ‚Üí `FALSE`
        
    - `x > ALL (empty)` ‚Üí `TRUE` (vacuously true)
        
- Use `ALL` carefully ‚Äî it‚Äôs **stricter** than `ANY`.
    

---

#### üí° Tip

| Use `ANY` when:                                                          | Use `ALL` when:                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| You want to check if a value is greater/less than **any** value in a set | You want to check if it‚Äôs greater/less than **all** |
| You're okay if **one** match works                                       | You need it to satisfy **all**                      |
### 9. `BETWEEN`

`BETWEEN` selects values within a specific range, including both endpoints.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 3000 AND 6000;
```

Returns employees with salaries between 3000 and 6000.

**Exclusive Range Example:** To exclude endpoints, use greater-than and less-than conditions.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 3000 AND salary < 6000;
```

### 10. `LIKE`

| LIKE Operator                | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WHERE first_name LIKE 'a%'   | Finds any values that start with "a"                                         |
| WHERE first_name LIKE '%a'   | Finds any values that end with "a"                                           |
| WHERE first_name LIKE '%or%' | Finds any values that have "or" in any position                              |
| WHERE first_name LIKE '_r%'  | Finds any values that have "r" in the second position                        |
| WHERE first_name LIKE 'a_%'  | Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length |
| WHERE first_name LIKE 'a__%' | Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length |
| WHERE first_name LIKE 'a%o'  | Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"                       |
`LIKE` is used for pattern matching. It works with the `%` and `_` wildcards:

- `%` matches any sequence of characters (including none).
- `_` matches exactly one character.

**Examples:**

- Starts with "A": `LIKE 'A%'`
- Ends with "s": `LIKE '%s'`
- Contains "mar": `LIKE '%mar%'`
- Second letter is "e": `LIKE '_e%'`

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

Returns employees whose names start with "A."

### 11. `REGEXP` (Regular Expressions)

`REGEXP` allows for more complex pattern matching than `LIKE`.

**Special Characters in REGEXP:**

- `^` ‚Äì Start of string.
- `$` ‚Äì End of string.
- `.` ‚Äì Any single character.
- `*` ‚Äì Zero or more occurrences of the previous character.
- `+` ‚Äì One or more occurrences of the previous character.
- `[ ]` ‚Äì Matches any character within brackets.
- `[a-z]` ‚Äì Range, matches any lowercase letter.

**Examples:**

- Starts with "A" and ends with "s": `^A.*s$`
- Contains "mar" in the middle: `.*mar.*`
- Name starts with a vowel: `^[AEIOUaeiou]`

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name REGEXP '^A.*s$';
```

Returns names starting with "A" and ending with "s."

### 12. `IS NULL`

`IS NULL` checks for `NULL` values in a column.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL;
```

Returns employees without a manager (`manager_id` is `NULL`).

### 13. `ORDER BY`

`ORDER BY` sorts results by one or more columns, defaulting to ascending order.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY age DESC;
```

Sorts employees by age in descending order.

**Multiple Columns:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;
```

Sorts by department in ascending order, then by salary in descending order.

### 14. `LIMIT`

`LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10;
```

Returns the first 10 rows of the result set.

### 15. `INNER JOIN`

`INNER JOIN` combines rows from two tables based on a common field, returning only matching rows.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

Retrieves employee names with their department names by matching `department_id`.

### 16. `ALIAS`

An alias gives a temporary name to a column or table, simplifying queries.

**Example of Column Alias:**

```sql
SELECT name AS employee_name, salary AS monthly_income FROM employees;
```

**Example of Table Alias:**

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

Using `e` as an alias for `employees` and `d` for `departments` makes the query shorter and more readable.


### `COALESCE()`
The `COALESCE()` function in SQL is used to **return the first non-NULL value** from a list of expressions.

---

#### üîπ Syntax

```sql
COALESCE(value1, value2, ..., valueN)
```

- It checks values from left to right.
    
- It returns the **first value that is NOT NULL**.
    
- If **all values are NULL**, it returns `NULL`.
    

---

#### ‚úÖ Example 1: Basic Usage

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, 'Hello', 'World');
```

üîπ **Output**:

```
Hello
```

üß† Explanation: It returns `'Hello'` because it's the **first non-NULL** value.

---

#### ‚úÖ Example 2: Handling NULL in Columns

Assume a `students` table:

|id|name|nickname|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|NULL|
|2|Bob|Bobby|
|3|Charlie|NULL|

You want to show the `nickname` if it exists, otherwise the `name`:

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(nickname, name) AS display_name
FROM students;
```

üîπ **Result**:

|display_name|
|---|
|Alice|
|Bobby|
|Charlie|

---

#### ‚úÖ Example 3: With Default Values

If a `salary` is NULL, show `0` instead:

```sql
SELECT name, COALESCE(salary, 0) AS salary
FROM employees;
```

---

#### ‚úÖ Example 4: With Multiple Fallbacks

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Fallback', 'Other');
```

üîπ Returns: `'Fallback'`

---

#### üîÅ COALESCE vs ISNULL vs IFNULL

|Function|DB Systems Supported|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`COALESCE`|‚úÖ ANSI SQL Standard|Returns first non-NULL from a list|
|`ISNULL(x, y)`|SQL Server only|Returns `x` if not NULL, else `y`|
|`IFNULL(x, y)`|MySQL only|Same as ISNULL|

---

#### üí° Use Cases

|Use Case|Example|
|---|---|
|Replace NULL with default|`COALESCE(address, 'Not Provided')`|
|Prioritize multiple optional fields|`COALESCE(email, phone, 'No Contact Info')`|
|Avoid NULL in calculations|`price * COALESCE(discount, 1)`|

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- All expressions in `COALESCE` should be of **compatible data types**.
    
- It stops evaluating as soon as it finds the **first non-NULL**.

### String Functions

---

## ‚úÖ 1. `CONCAT()` ‚Äì Join Strings Together

### üîπ Purpose:

Used to **combine two or more strings** into one.

### ‚úÖ Syntax:

```sql
CONCAT(string1, string2, ..., stringN)
```

### ‚úÖ Example:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT('Hello', ' ', 'World') AS result;
```

üî∏ **Output:**

> ‚úÖ Note:
> 
> - `LEN()` is used in **SQL Server**
>     
> - `LENGTH()` is used in **MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite**
>     

### ‚úÖ Syntax (SQL Server):

```sql
SELECT LEN('Hello') AS len;
```

üî∏ Output:

```
5
```

### ‚úÖ Syntax (MySQL, PostgreSQL):

|`LENGTH()`|Length of string (MySQL/PostgreSQL)|`LENGTH('Hello')`|`5`|
|`UPPER()`|Converts to uppercase|`UPPER('hello')`|`'HELLO'`|
|`LOWER()`|Converts to lowercase|`LOWER('HELLO')`|`'hello'`|

---

Let me know if you want examples with `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, or `CASE` using these functions!

### **CASE Statement in SQL**

The `CASE` statement in SQL is used for conditional logic within SQL queries. It works like an `IF-ELSE` statement in programming languages. You can use it to return different values based on conditions.

---

#### **Syntax of CASE**

There are two main types of `CASE` expressions in SQL:

#### **1. Simple CASE Expression**

This compares a column or expression against multiple values and returns a result.

```sql
CASE column_name
    WHEN value1 THEN result1
    WHEN value2 THEN result2
    ELSE default_result
END
```

#### **2. Searched CASE Expression**

This evaluates multiple conditions and returns a result based on the first `TRUE` condition.

```sql
CASE 
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ELSE default_result
END
```

---

#### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Using Simple CASE**

Let's say we have a `students` table:

|student_id|name|grade|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alex|A|
|2|Bob|B|
|3|Chris|C|
|4|David|A|

We want to classify students based on their grades:

```sql
SELECT name, grade,
    CASE grade
        WHEN 'A' THEN 'Excellent'
        WHEN 'B' THEN 'Good'
        WHEN 'C' THEN 'Average'
        ELSE 'Needs Improvement'
    END AS performance
FROM students;
```

**Output:**

|name|grade|performance|
|---|---|---|
|Alex|A|Excellent|
|Bob|B|Good|
|Chris|C|Average|
|David|A|Excellent|

---

#### **Example 2: Using Searched CASE**

Suppose we have an `employees` table:

|emp_id|name|salary|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|90000|
|2|Bob|75000|
|3|Charlie|50000|
|4|David|30000|

We want to categorize employees based on their salary:

```sql
SELECT name, salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary >= 80000 THEN 'High Salary'
        WHEN salary >= 50000 THEN 'Medium Salary'
        ELSE 'Low Salary'
    END AS salary_category
FROM employees;
```

**Output:**

|name|salary|salary_category|
|---|---|---|
|Alice|90000|High Salary|
|Bob|75000|Medium Salary|
|Charlie|50000|Medium Salary|
|David|30000|Low Salary|

---

#### **Using CASE in ORDER BY**

You can also use `CASE` in `ORDER BY` to define custom sorting:

```sql
SELECT name, grade
FROM students
ORDER BY 
    CASE grade 
        WHEN 'A' THEN 1
        WHEN 'B' THEN 2
        WHEN 'C' THEN 3
        ELSE 4
    END;
```

This sorts `A` grades first, then `B`, then `C`.

---

#### **Using CASE in UPDATE**

You can use `CASE` in an `UPDATE` statement:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 
    CASE 
        WHEN salary < 40000 THEN salary + 5000
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 70000 THEN salary + 3000
        ELSE salary + 2000
    END;
```

This increases salary based on different conditions.

---

#### **Conclusion**

- `CASE` helps in conditional logic inside SQL queries.
- It works in `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, `UPDATE`, and `WHERE` clauses.
- It is similar to `IF-ELSE` statements in programming.

### **1. Inner Joins**

An **inner join** retrieves records with matching values in both tables.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT customers.first_name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

- Retrieves customers and their order dates.
- Rows without a match in `orders` are excluded.

---

### **2. Joining Across Databases**

You can join tables across different databases by qualifying the database names.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT db1.customers.first_name, db2.orders.order_date
FROM db1.customers
INNER JOIN db2.orders
ON db1.customers.customer_id = db2.orders.customer_id;
```

- Joins the `customers` table in `db1` with the `orders` table in `db2`.

### **üîπ LEFT JOIN in SQL (with a Clear Example)**

A **LEFT JOIN** in SQL returns **all rows from the left table** and **matching rows from the right table**. If there is **no match in the right table, NULL values** are returned for columns from the right table.

---

### **üìå Example Scenario**

We have two tables:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ `students` ‚Üí Contains student details  
2Ô∏è‚É£ `courses` ‚Üí Contains course details

#### **üîπ students Table**

|student_id|name|age|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|22|
|2|Bob|23|
|3|John|24|
|4|Emma|21|

#### **üîπ courses Table**

|course_id|student_id|course_name|
|---|---|---|
|101|1|Math|
|102|2|Science|
|103|4|History|

---

### **üîπ LEFT JOIN Query**

```sql
SELECT students.student_id, students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
LEFT JOIN courses ON students.student_id = courses.student_id;
```

---

### **üîπ Output of the Query**

|student_id|name|course_name|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|Math|
|2|Bob|Science|
|3|John|NULL|
|4|Emma|History|

---

### **üîπ Explanation**

- **Alice (ID=1)** ‚Üí Has a course ("Math") ‚úÖ
- **Bob (ID=2)** ‚Üí Has a course ("Science") ‚úÖ
- **Emma (ID=4)** ‚Üí Has a course ("History") ‚úÖ
- **John (ID=3)** ‚Üí Has **no matching course** in the `courses` table, so `NULL` appears in the `course_name` column ‚ùå

---

### **üîπ Key Points**

‚úÖ **Returns all records from the left table (`students`)**  
‚úÖ **Matches records from the right table (`courses`)**  
‚úÖ **If there is no match, NULL is returned for the right table columns**

Would you like an example with real SQL execution? üöÄ

---

### **4. Joining Multiple Tables**

Joins more than two tables.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT customers.first_name, orders.order_date, shippers.name AS shipper_name
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
JOIN shippers ON orders.shipper_id = shippers.shipper_id;
```

- Retrieves customers, their order dates, and the shipper name.

---

### **5. Compound Join Conditions**

Joins tables with multiple conditions.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id
AND e.hire_date > '2020-01-01';
```

- Joins employees and departments where the department matches and the employee was hired after 2020.

---

### **6. Implicit Join Syntax**

Joins without the `JOIN` keyword (old-style).

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT customers.first_name, orders.order_date
FROM customers, orders
WHERE customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

- Less readable; not recommended.

---

### **7. Outer Joins**

Includes rows with no match from one or both tables.

#### Example:

**Left Outer Join:**

```sql
SELECT customers.first_name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

- Includes all customers, even those without orders.

**Right Outer Join:**

```sql
SELECT orders.order_date, customers.first_name
FROM orders
RIGHT JOIN customers
ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```

- Includes all orders, even those without customers.

---

### **8. Outer Join Between Multiple Tables**

Combines multiple outer joins.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, o.order_date, sh.name AS shipper_name
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
LEFT JOIN shippers sh ON o.shipper_id = sh.shipper_id;
```

- Includes all customers, their orders (if any), and shipper details.

---

### **9. Self Outer Joins**

### **üîπ SELF JOIN in SQL (with Clear Explanation & Example)**

A **SELF JOIN** is when a table joins with **itself**. This is useful for hierarchical relationships like **employees & managers**, **students & mentors**, or **parent-child relationships**.

---

### **üìå Example Scenario: Employee-Manager Relationship**

We have a **single table `employees`** where each employee has a **manager_id** (which refers to another employee in the same table).

#### **üîπ employees Table**

|employee_id|name|manager_id|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|NULL|
|2|Bob|1|
|3|John|1|
|4|Emma|2|
|5|Chris|2|

### **üîπ SELF JOIN Query**

```sql
SELECT e1.employee_id AS EmployeeID, e1.name AS Employee, 
       e2.employee_id AS ManagerID, e2.name AS Manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 
ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

---

### **üîπ Output of the Query**

|EmployeeID|Employee|ManagerID|Manager|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|NULL|NULL|
|2|Bob|1|Alice|
|3|John|1|Alice|
|4|Emma|2|Bob|
|5|Chris|2|Bob|

---

### **üîπ Explanation**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Alice (ID=1)** has no manager (`NULL`).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Bob (ID=2) & John (ID=3)** report to **Alice (ID=1)**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Emma (ID=4) & Chris (ID=5)** report to **Bob (ID=2)**.

---

### **üîπ Key Points**

‚úÖ **SELF JOIN treats a table like two different tables** using aliases (`e1` & `e2`).  
‚úÖ Used for **hierarchical data** like employees-managers, students-mentors, etc.  
‚úÖ Can be `INNER JOIN` (only matched results) or `LEFT JOIN` (keep all employees, even without a manager).

### **10. The USING Clause**

Simplifies join conditions when column names are the same.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
JOIN orders USING (customer_id);
```

- Same as `ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id`.

---

### **11. Natural Joins**

Automatically joins tables with matching column names.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
NATURAL JOIN orders;
```

- Joins on columns with the same name.

---

### **12. Cross Joins**

### **What is a CROSS JOIN?**

A **CROSS JOIN** produces a **Cartesian Product** of two tables, meaning **each row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table**.

üîπ **Key Points:**

- **No ON condition is used** (unlike INNER/LEFT/RIGHT JOIN).
- If **Table A has `m` rows** and **Table B has `n` rows**, the result will have **`m √ó n` rows**.
- It is useful for **generating combinations of values**.

---



## **üîπ Example Scenario: University Database**

Consider two tables:

### **üîπ students Table**

|student_id|name|
|---|---|
|1|Alice|
|2|Bob|
|3|John|

### **üîπ courses Table**

|course_id|course_name|
|---|---|
|101|Math|
|102|Physics|

---

## **üîπ CROSS JOIN Example**

**Goal:** Get **all possible combinations** of students and courses.

sql

CopyEdit

`SELECT students.name, courses.course_name FROM students CROSS JOIN courses;`

### **üîπ Output**

|name|course_name|
|---|---|
|Alice|Math|
|Alice|Physics|
|Bob|Math|
|Bob|Physics|
|John|Math|
|John|Physics|

#### **üîπ Explanation**

- **Every student is paired with every course.**
- **3 students √ó 2 courses = 6 rows in output.**

---

## **üîπ When to Use CROSS JOIN?**

‚úÖ **Generating all possible combinations** (e.g., students & courses, products & discounts, etc.).  
‚úÖ **Simulating permutations** where each item in one table must be paired with all items in another.  
‚úÖ **Filling missing data by creating all possible pairs before filtering out unwanted ones.**

---
### **üîπ RIGHT JOIN and FULL JOIN (With Clear Examples)**

#### **üìå What are RIGHT JOIN & FULL JOIN?**

- **RIGHT JOIN** ‚Üí Returns **all records from the right table** and **only matching records from the left table**. If there is no match, it fills `NULL` for the left table's columns.
- **FULL JOIN** (or **FULL OUTER JOIN**) ‚Üí Returns **all records from both tables**, filling `NULL` where there is no match.

---

### **üîπ Example Scenario: University Database**

We use the same **`students`** and **`courses`** tables from earlier but focus only on these:

#### **üîπ students Table**

|student_id|name|
|---|---|
|1|Alice|
|2|Bob|
|3|John|

#### **üîπ enrollments Table**

|student_id|course_id|
|---|---|
|1|101|
|1|102|
|3|101|
|4|103|

üîπ **Notice:**

- **Student 2 (Bob)** is **not enrolled** in any course.
- **Student 4 (not in `students` table)** appears in `enrollments`.

---

## **üîπ RIGHT JOIN Example**

**Goal:** Get all enrollments and include student details if available.

```sql
SELECT students.student_id, students.name, enrollments.course_id
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN enrollments ON students.student_id = enrollments.student_id;
```

### **üîπ Output**

|student_id|name|course_id|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|101|
|1|Alice|102|
|3|John|101|
|NULL|NULL|103|

#### **üîπ Explanation**

- Students **1 (Alice) & 3 (John)** match and are displayed with their courses. ‚úÖ
- **Course 103 has a student (ID=4) not in `students`, so NULL appears for `student_id` & `name`**. ‚ùå

---

## **üîπ FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN) Example**

**Goal:** Get **all students and all enrollments**, even if there is **no match**.

```sql
SELECT students.student_id, students.name, enrollments.course_id
FROM students
FULL JOIN enrollments ON students.student_id = enrollments.student_id;
```

### **üîπ Output**

|student_id|name|course_id|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|101|
|1|Alice|102|
|2|Bob|NULL|
|3|John|101|
|NULL|NULL|103|

#### **üîπ Explanation**

- **Students Alice & John** match their enrollments. ‚úÖ
- **Bob (ID=2) has no enrollments, so `NULL` appears in `course_id`**. ‚ùå
- **Course 103 (student ID=4) has no matching student, so `NULL` appears for `student_id` & `name`**. ‚ùå

---

## **üîπ When to Use?**

‚úÖ **RIGHT JOIN** ‚Üí When you need **all records from the right table** and matching records from the left.  
‚úÖ **FULL JOIN** ‚Üí When you need **all data from both tables, even if there is no match**.

Would you like an example with more complex conditions? üöÄ
## **üîπ Difference from Other Joins**

| Join Type      | Behavior                                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **INNER JOIN** | Returns only matching records.                                              |
| **LEFT JOIN**  | Returns all left table records + matching right table records.              |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | Returns all right table records + matching left table records.              |
| **FULL JOIN**  | Returns all records from both tables (fills NULLs for no matches).          |
| **CROSS JOIN** | Returns **every combination** of rows from both tables (Cartesian Product). |

### **üìå What is UNION?**

The **`UNION`** operator is used to **combine the results of two or more `SELECT` queries** into a single result set.

üîπ **Key Rules of `UNION`:**

1. **Both `SELECT` queries must have the same number of columns**.
2. **The columns must have compatible data types**.
3. **By default, `UNION` removes duplicate rows**.
4. Use **`UNION ALL`** to include duplicates.

---

## **üîπ Example Scenario: University Database**

We have two tables:

### **üîπ students_2023 Table**

|student_id|name|
|---|---|
|1|Alice|
|2|Bob|
|3|John|

### **üîπ students_2024 Table**

|student_id|name|
|---|---|
|3|John|
|4|Emma|
|5|David|

---

## **üîπ Example 1: Using `UNION` (Removes Duplicates)**

We want a **list of all unique students** from both tables.

```sql
SELECT student_id, name FROM students_2023
UNION
SELECT student_id, name FROM students_2024;
```

### **üîπ Output**

|student_id|name|
|---|---|
|1|Alice|
|2|Bob|
|3|John|
|4|Emma|
|5|David|

#### **üîπ Explanation**

- **John (student_id=3) appeared in both tables, but UNION removes duplicates.**
- The result contains **only unique records**.

---

## **üîπ Example 2: Using `UNION ALL` (Includes Duplicates)**

If we **want to keep duplicates**, use `UNION ALL`:

```sql
SELECT student_id, name FROM students_2023
UNION ALL
SELECT student_id, name FROM students_2024;
```

### **üîπ Output**

|student_id|name|
|---|---|
|1|Alice|
|2|Bob|
|3|John|
|3|John|
|4|Emma|
|5|David|

#### **üîπ Explanation**

- **John appears twice** because we used `UNION ALL`.
- `UNION ALL` **does not remove duplicates**.

---

## **üîπ When to Use?**

‚úÖ **`UNION`** ‚Üí When you **want only unique results** (removes duplicates).  
‚úÖ **`UNION ALL`** ‚Üí When you **want all results, including duplicates**.

Would you like an example where `UNION` is used with additional filtering? üöÄ

## Aggregate Function

### ‚úÖ What Are Aggregate Functions in SQL?

**Aggregate functions** perform a **calculation on a set of values** and return a **single summary value**.

They are often used with `GROUP BY` or in queries to get totals, averages, counts, etc.

---

### üî∏ Common Aggregate Functions

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|`COUNT()`|Counts rows|
|`SUM()`|Adds up numeric values|
|`AVG()`|Calculates average of numeric values|
|`MIN()`|Finds the smallest (minimum) value|
|`MAX()`|Finds the largest (maximum) value|

---

### üîπ 1. `COUNT()` ‚Äì Count Rows

#### ‚úÖ Example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
```

üî∏ Counts **all rows** in the `employees` table.

---

#### ‚úÖ With a condition:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

üî∏ Counts only employees in the Sales department.

---

### üîπ 2. `SUM()` ‚Äì Total of Column

#### ‚úÖ Example:

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) 
FROM employees;
```

üî∏ Returns the total salary paid to all employees.

---

### üîπ 3. `AVG()` ‚Äì Average Value

#### ‚úÖ Example:

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) 
FROM employees;
```

üî∏ Gives the **average salary** of all employees.

---

### üîπ 4. `MIN()` and `MAX()` ‚Äì Lowest & Highest

#### ‚úÖ Example:

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary), MAX(salary) 
FROM employees;
```

üî∏ Shows:

- The **lowest salary** in the company
    
- The **highest salary**
    

---

#### üî∏ Using `GROUP BY` with Aggregate Functions

You can use `GROUP BY` to get aggregate values **per group**.

#### üßæ Example Table: `employees`

|id|name|department|salary|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|HR|30000|
|2|Bob|IT|50000|
|3|Jane|HR|35000|
|4|Mark|IT|60000|

---

#### ‚úÖ Query: Average Salary Per Department

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

üî∏ Output:

|department|avg(salary)|
|---|---|
|HR|32500|
|IT|55000|

---

### üî∏ Filtering Aggregates with `HAVING`

Use `HAVING` to filter **after aggregation** (not `WHERE`).

#### ‚úÖ Query: Departments with average salary > 40000

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 40000;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary Table

|Function|Purpose|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`COUNT()`|Count rows|`COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(column)`|
|`SUM()`|Add values|`SUM(price)`|
|`AVG()`|Average of values|`AVG(score)`|
|`MIN()`|Smallest value|`MIN(age)`|
|`MAX()`|Largest value|`MAX(salary)`|

---

### üß† Notes

- `COUNT(*)` counts **all rows**, even if there are NULLs.
    
- `COUNT(column)` ignores **NULL values**.
    
- `AVG()`, `SUM()` work only on numeric data.
    
- Combine with `GROUP BY` to get per-group summaries.
    
- Use `HAVING` to filter groups **after aggregation**.
    

---

Would you like some **practice problems**, or a **visual example** using real data?
## GROUP BY ‚Äì What is it?

**`GROUP BY`** is used to **group rows** that have the same values in a specified column. After grouping, we can use **aggregate functions** like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, etc., to perform calculations on each group.

### **üîπ Syntax**

```sql
SELECT column_name, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```

- `column_name`: The column on which we are grouping.
- `AGGREGATE_FUNCTION()`: A function like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, etc.
- `GROUP BY column_name`: Groups the rows based on that column.

---

### **üìå Example 1: Counting Employees in Each Department**

#### **üë®‚Äçüíª Sample `employees` Table**

|employee_id|name|department|salary|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|IT|50,000|
|2|Bob|HR|60,000|
|3|John|IT|55,000|
|4|Emma|HR|70,000|
|5|Max|IT|65,000|

#### **‚úÖ Query: Count the number of employees in each department**

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

#### **üîπ Output**

|department|num_employees|
|---|---|
|IT|3|
|HR|2|

‚úÖ **Explanation**:

- It **groups** all employees by `department`.
- Then, it **counts** the number of employees in each group.

---

### **üìå Example 2: Find the Average Salary for Each Department**

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

#### **üîπ Output**

|department|avg_salary|
|---|---|
|IT|56,666.67|
|HR|65,000|

‚úÖ **Explanation**:

- The salaries for **IT**: (50,000 + 55,000 + 65,000) / 3 = **56,666.67**
- The salaries for **HR**: (60,000 + 70,000) / 2 = **65,000**

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ HAVING ‚Äì What is it?**

The **HAVING** clause is used to **filter grouped results** after applying `GROUP BY`.

- It is **similar to `WHERE`**, but **WHERE works on individual rows**, whereas **HAVING works on groups**.

### **üîπ Syntax**

```sql
SELECT column_name, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
```

- `HAVING condition`: Specifies the condition for filtering the grouped results.

---

### **üìå Example 3: Show Only Departments Where More Than 2 Employees Work**

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
```

#### **üîπ Output**

|department|num_employees|
|---|---|
|IT|3|

‚úÖ **Explanation**:

- It first groups the data by `department`.
- Then, it **counts employees** in each department.
- The `HAVING COUNT(*) > 2` **filters out** departments where employees are 2 or fewer.

---

### **üìå Example 4: Show Only Departments Where the Average Salary is Above 60,000**

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;
```

#### **üîπ Output**

|department|avg_salary|
|---|---|
|HR|65,000|

‚úÖ **Explanation**:

- It calculates **average salary** for each department.
- It filters out departments where `AVG(salary) > 60000`.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Difference Between WHERE and HAVING**

|Feature|WHERE|HAVING|
|---|---|---|
|Used for|Filtering individual rows|Filtering groups (after `GROUP BY`)|
|Works on|Single row at a time|Aggregated results|
|Aggregate functions allowed?|‚ùå No|‚úÖ Yes|

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ WHEN TO USE GROUP BY AND HAVING?**

- Use **`GROUP BY`** when you need to **summarize data**.
- Use **`HAVING`** when you need to **filter grouped data**.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Life Example**

### **üìå Example 5: Finding High-Revenue Customers**

#### **üë®‚Äçüíª Sample `orders` Table**

|order_id|customer_name|total_amount|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|200|
|2|Bob|450|
|3|Alice|300|
|4|Bob|500|
|5|John|150|

#### **‚úÖ Query: Find customers whose total spending is more than $500**

```sql
SELECT customer_name, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_name
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 500;
```

#### **üîπ Output**

|customer_name|total_spent|
|---|---|
|Bob|950|

‚úÖ **Explanation**:

- It **groups orders by `customer_name`**.
- It **calculates total spending** for each customer.
- It **filters out customers who spent less than 500**.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Summary**

|Clause|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**GROUP BY**|Groups data based on one or more columns|
|**HAVING**|Filters grouped data (works **after** GROUP BY)|
|**WHERE**|Filters individual rows (works **before** GROUP BY)|

## **üîπ SQL Subqueries (With Clear Examples)**

A **subquery** is a SQL query **inside another query**. It can be used in **`SELECT`**, **`FROM`**, **`WHERE`**, or **`HAVING`** clauses.

---

## **üîπ Types of Subqueries**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Subquery in `SELECT` (Scalar Subquery)**

- Used to **fetch a single value** and use it in the main query.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Subquery in `WHERE` (Filtering Condition)**

- Used to **filter results based on another query**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Subquery in `FROM` (Derived Table)**

- Used to **treat a subquery result as a table**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Subquery in `HAVING` (Filtering Groups)**

- Used to **filter grouped data**.

---

## **üîπ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Subquery in `SELECT` Clause**

**Goal:** Find employee salaries and how they compare to the **average salary**.

```sql
SELECT name, salary, 
       (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) AS avg_salary
FROM employees;
```

### **üîπ Output**

|name|salary|avg_salary|
|---|---|---|
|Alice|50,000|58,750|
|Bob|60,000|58,750|
|John|55,000|58,750|
|Emma|70,000|58,750|

‚úÖ **The subquery calculates the average salary** and displays it in each row.

---

## **üîπ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Subquery in `WHERE` Clause**

**Goal:** Get employees earning **above the average salary**.

```sql
SELECT name, salary 
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

### **üîπ Output**

|name|salary|
|---|---|
|Bob|60,000|
|Emma|70,000|

‚úÖ **The subquery calculates the average salary**, and the main query filters employees with higher salaries.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Subquery in `FROM` Clause (Derived Table)**

### **üîπ Query Breakdown**

```sql
SELECT department_id, avg_salary 
FROM (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees 
    GROUP BY department_id
) AS dept_avg;
```

### **üîπ What This Query Does**

1. **Inner Query (Subquery)**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees 
    GROUP BY department_id;
    ```
    
    - This **groups** employees by `department_id`.
    - It calculates the **average salary** for each department.
2. **Outer Query**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT department_id, avg_salary 
    FROM (...) AS dept_avg;
    ```
    
    - The **outer query** selects the `department_id` and `avg_salary` from the **subquery result**.

---

### **üîπ Example with Data**

#### **üë®‚Äçüíª Sample `employees` Table**

|employee_id|name|salary|department_id|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|50,000|1|
|2|Bob|60,000|2|
|3|John|55,000|1|
|4|Emma|70,000|3|

#### **üîπ Step 1: Subquery Result (Average Salary per Department)**

|department_id|avg_salary|
|---|---|
|1|52,500|
|2|60,000|
|3|70,000|

#### **üîπ Step 2: Outer Query Reads the Table**

- The main query **fetches results from this derived table** and displays them.

### **üîπ Final Output**

|department_id|avg_salary|
|---|---|
|1|52,500|
|2|60,000|
|3|70,000|

‚úÖ **This method is useful when you need to compute something first and then filter or process it further.**

SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary) > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

### **üîπ Understanding `HAVING`**

- The `HAVING` clause is **like `WHERE` but for grouped data**.
- `WHERE` filters **individual rows**, while `HAVING` filters **grouped results**.

---

### **üîπ Step-by-Step Execution**

#### **Step 1: Find Overall Average Salary**

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
```

- Total salaries: **50,000 + 60,000 + 55,000 + 70,000 = 235,000**
- Employee count: **4**
- **Global average salary:** 235,000√∑4=58,750235,000 \div 4 = 58,750

#### **Step 2: Compute Department-Wise Average**

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

|department_id|avg_salary|
|---|---|
|1|52,500|
|2|60,000|
|3|70,000|

#### **Step 3: Apply `HAVING` Clause**

```sql
HAVING AVG(salary) > 58,750;
```

- Only **departments with an average salary greater than 58,750** are kept.
- Department **1 is removed** because 52,500 < 58,750.

---

### **üîπ Final Output**

|department_id|avg_salary|
|---|---|
|3|70,000|

‚úÖ **Only department 3 remains because its average salary (70,000) is greater than the global average salary (58,750).**

## **üîπ Key Takeaways**

### **üìå Subquery in `FROM` (Derived Table)**

‚úî The **subquery acts as a temporary table**.  
‚úî Useful when you need to **precompute** something and use it in the main query.

### **üìå Subquery in `HAVING` (Filtering Groups)**

‚úî `HAVING` is used **after `GROUP BY`** to filter grouped results.  
‚úî `HAVING AVG(salary) > (SELECT AVG(salary))` **compares each department‚Äôs average salary to the overall average**.

---

## **üîπ Summary Table**

|**Type**|**When to Use?**|**Example Use Case**|
|---|---|---|
|**Subquery in `FROM`**|When you need to **create a temporary table** for further filtering|Find **average salary per department**|
|**Subquery in `HAVING`**|When you need to **filter groups** based on a condition|Find **departments where the avg salary is above the global avg**|

# **Window Function**
## ‚úÖ What Is a Window Function?

A **window function** performs a **calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row**, without collapsing the rows like `GROUP BY` does.

üîπ It **does not group or reduce** the number of rows ‚Äî instead, it returns a **value for each row** based on a **"window" (a subset of rows)**.

---

## üß† Syntax of Window Function

sql

CopyEdit

`<function_name>() OVER (     [PARTITION BY column]     [ORDER BY column]     [ROWS ...] )`

---

## üìå Most Common Window Functions

|Function|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`ROW_NUMBER()`|Assigns a unique row number|
|`RANK()`|Gives rank with gaps|
|`DENSE_RANK()`|Gives rank without gaps|
|`NTILE(N)`|Divides rows into N equal groups|
|`SUM()`|Running or partitioned sum|
|`AVG()`|Running or partitioned average|
|`LEAD()`|Get next row‚Äôs value|
|`LAG()`|Get previous row‚Äôs value|

---

## üéØ Sample Table: `sales`

Imagine we have this table:

| id | employee | department | sales |
| -- | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1  | Alice    | A          | 500   |
| 2  | Bob      | A          | 300   |
| 3  | Carol    | B          | 800   |
| 4  | Dave     | A          | 700   |
| 5  | Erin     | B          | 600   |

---

## üî∏ 1. `ROW_NUMBER()` ‚Äì Unique number per row (per group)

```sql
SELECT employee, department, sales,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY sales DESC) AS row_num
FROM sales;
```

üìå This assigns a **unique number** starting from 1 **within each department**, based on `sales DESC`.

### üßæ Output:

| employee | department | sales | row\_num |
| -------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| Dave     | A          | 700   | 1        |
| Alice    | A          | 500   | 2        |
| Bob      | A          | 300   | 3        |
| Carol    | B          | 800   | 1        |
| Erin     | B          | 600   | 2        |

### What are `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`?

Both are **window functions** used to assign a rank to each row within a partition of a result set based on a specific column order (typically used with `ORDER BY` inside `OVER()`).

- **`RANK()`**: Gives **gaps** in ranking when there are ties.
    
- **`DENSE_RANK()`**: Gives **no gaps**‚Äîranks increase consecutively even if there are ties.
    

---

### üî∏ Example Table: `Sales`

|Employee|Region|Sales|
|---|---|---|
|Alice|East|1000|
|Bob|East|900|
|Carol|East|900|
|Dave|East|800|
|Eve|West|950|
|Frank|West|950|
|Grace|West|900|

---

### üîπ SQL Query with `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`

sql

CopyEdit

`SELECT      Employee,     Region,     Sales,     RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY Sales DESC) AS rank_pos,     DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY Sales DESC) AS dense_rank_pos FROM Sales;`

---

### üî∏ Output Explained

|Employee|Region|Sales|RANK()|DENSE_RANK()|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Alice|East|1000|1|1|
|Bob|East|900|2|2|
|Carol|East|900|2|2|
|Dave|East|800|4|3|
|Eve|West|950|1|1|
|Frank|West|950|1|1|
|Grace|West|900|3|2|

---

### ‚úÖ Key Differences:

- In the **East region**, Bob and Carol tie with 900 sales:
    
    - `RANK()` assigns both a **2**, but the next rank is **4** (skips 3).
        
    - `DENSE_RANK()` assigns both a **2**, and the next rank is **3** (no gap).
        
- In the **West region**, Eve and Frank tie with 950 sales:
    
    - `RANK()` assigns both a **1**, next is **3** (Grace).
        
    - `DENSE_RANK()` assigns both a **1**, next is **2**.
        

---

### üîπ When to Use Which?

- Use **`RANK()`** if you want to reflect the true **position including ties** (with skipped ranks).
    
- Use **`DENSE_RANK()`** if you want to **avoid gaps** in ranking.
## üî∏ 4. `SUM()` ‚Äì Running total (cumulative)

```sql
SELECT employee, department, sales,
  SUM(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY sales) AS running_total
FROM sales;
```

üìå For each department, it adds up the sales **up to the current row** (running total).

### üßæ Output:

| employee | dept | sales | running\_total |
| -------- | ---- | ----- | -------------- |
| Bob      | A    | 300   | 300            |
| Alice    | A    | 500   | 800            |
| Dave     | A    | 700   | 1500           |
| Erin     | B    | 600   | 600            |
| Carol    | B    | 800   | 1400           |

---

## üî∏ 5. `LAG()` ‚Äì Previous row‚Äôs value

```sql
SELECT employee, department, sales,
  LAG(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY sales) AS previous_sales
FROM sales;
```

üìå Shows the `sales` value of the **previous row** in each department group.

### üßæ Output:

| employee | dept | sales | previous\_sales |
| -------- | ---- | ----- | --------------- |
| Bob      | A    | 300   | NULL            |
| Alice    | A    | 500   | 300             |
| Dave     | A    | 700   | 500             |
| Erin     | B    | 600   | NULL            |
| Carol    | B    | 800   | 600             |

---

## üî∏ 6. `LEAD()` ‚Äì Next row‚Äôs value

```sql
SELECT employee, department, sales,
  LEAD(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY sales) AS next_sales
FROM sales;
```

üìå Shows the `sales` value of the **next row** in each department group.

### üßæ Output:

| employee | dept | sales | next\_sales |
| -------- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| Bob      | A    | 300   | 500         |
| Alice    | A    | 500   | 700         |
| Dave     | A    | 700   | NULL        |
| Erin     | B    | 600   | 800         |
| Carol    | B    | 800   | NULL        |

---

## üî∏ 7. `NTILE(n)` ‚Äì Split rows into buckets

```sql
SELECT employee, department, sales,
  NTILE(2) OVER (ORDER BY sales DESC) AS bucket
FROM sales;
```

üìå Divides the entire result set into **2 groups** (as evenly as possible).

### üßæ Output:

| employee | sales | bucket |
| -------- | ----- | ------ |
| Carol    | 800   | 1      |
| Dave     | 700   | 1      |
| Erin     | 600   | 1      |
| Alice    | 500   | 2      |
| Bob      | 300   | 2      |
