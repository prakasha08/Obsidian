# COMPILER AND INTERPRETED LANGUAGES
#COMPILERANDINTERPRETEDLANGUAGES
## COMPILER
- A compiler is an special Program to that process the statements written in a particular programming language.

## interpreted
- It read each statements of code. Then execute it directly.

- Java is inbetween compiler and Interpreter.

### Java and JVM.
- Java is often referred to as a "compiled and interpreted" language because of its two-stage execution model involving both compilation and interpretation. Let's break down the process:

1. **Compilation:**
    - When you write Java code, you save it in a file with a `.java` extension. This file is the source code.
    - The Java source code is then compiled by the Java Compiler (`javac`). The compiler translates the human-readable Java source code into an intermediate form known as bytecode. Bytecode is a low-level, platform-independent representation of the source code.
    - The output of the compilation process is one or more `.class` files containing the bytecode.

2. **Intermediate Representation (Bytecode):**
    - The generated bytecode is not machine code for any specific hardware architecture. Instead, it is designed to be executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    - The JVM is a runtime environment that is responsible for executing Java bytecode. It acts as an abstraction layer between the Java program and the underlying hardware.

3. **Interpretation:**
    - When you run a Java program, the JVM takes the bytecode and interprets it at runtime. The interpreter reads the bytecode line by line and executes the corresponding machine-level instructions.
    - This interpretation process allows Java to be platform-independent because the same bytecode can be executed on any device that has a compatible JVM.

4. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:**
    - To improve performance, many modern Java Virtual Machines use a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.
    - The JIT compiler translates the bytecode into native machine code specific to the host system at runtime, caching the result for subsequent executions. This native code is then executed directly by the CPU.
    - JIT compilation combines elements of both interpretation and compilation. It translates parts of the bytecode into machine code as needed, reducing interpretation overhead and improving execution speed.

In summary, Java is considered both compiled and interpreted due to its two-stage execution model. The initial compilation produces bytecode, which is then interpreted or further compiled by the JVM, including the use of JIT compilation for better performance. This combination of compilation and interpretation provides platform independence, as well as the potential for optimized native code execution.

# Static & Dynamic Type Checking
#StaticandDynamicTypeChecking
- Type -AKA data type, is a classification identification one of the types of Data. Strings ,Integer, Objects ,Arrays   ,Maps....
- **The Process of Verifying and Enforcing the constraints of types -type checking- may occur either at compile time(a static check) or at run-time(dynamic check).
- java-Static type Check
- java script-Dynamic type check.

- IF error occur,it will not give the O/P.eg:![[Screenshot 2024-01-22 210846.png]]

## Dynamic Type Checking(JAVA SCRIPT)
- ![[Screenshot 2024-01-22 210737.png]]
- If error occur,it execute and give O/P until the line where error occur.

# Difference Between JDK, JRE, and JVM
 **JDK (Java Development Kit):**

- **Full-Form:** JDK stands for Java Development Kit.
- **Components:** It includes all the tools, executables, and binaries required to compile, debug, and execute a Java program.
- **Platform Dependency:** JDK is platform dependent, meaning there are separate installers for Windows, Mac, and Unix systems.
- **Inclusion:** JDK includes both JRE and JVM and is responsible for code execution [1](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/differences-between-jdk-jre-and-jvm).

**JRE (Java Runtime Environment):**

- **Full-Form:** JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
- **Components:** It consists mainly of Java binaries and other classes to execute the program, along with various deployment technologies, user interface toolkits, and runtime instance [2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-jdk-jre-jvm/).
- **Inclusion:** JRE includes the JVM and other runtime components, but it does not contain any development tools such as Java compiler and debugger [3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/difference-jdk-vs-jre-vs-jvm).

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**

- **Full-Form:** JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
- **Functionality:** It is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It is also responsible for executing Java programs line by line, making it an interpreter [2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-jdk-jre-jvm/).
- **Platform Dependency:** JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms, and they are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different from each other. However, Java itself is platform independent [4](https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-jdk-jre-and-jvm).

In summary, **JDK** is used for developing applications in Java and includes all the necessary tools, **JRE** is used for running Java programs and includes the JVM and other runtime components, and **JVM** is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment for executing Java bytecode.

#   THEN HOW JAVA IS INDEPENDENT EVENTHOUGH JVM IS DEPENDENT ON PLATFORM.
#### Java's Platform Independence and JVM's Platform Dependence

Java is often referred to as a platform-independent language because the same Java code can run on different platforms without modification. This platform independence is primarily achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and several key language design decisions.

The Java code you write is first compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler. This bytecode is a platform-independent intermediate representation of your code, which means it can be run on any platform that has a JVM. The JVM then interprets this bytecode and executes it on the specific hardware of the platform.

However, the JVM itself is platform-dependent. This means that different systems have different JVMs. For example, Mac OS has a different JVM, and Windows will have a different JVM. Each JVM is designed to operate with the specific architecture and operating system where it runs. It takes the platform-independent Java bytecode and translates it into platform-specific machine code. This is why you need to download a different JVM for Windows, Mac, or any other operating system.

So, while the JVM is platform-dependent, it enables Java to be platform-independent. The JVM acts as a bridge between the platform-independent Java bytecode and the platform-dependent machine code. This design allows Java developers to "write once, run anywhere," which is a key advantage of using Java.

In summary, Java's platform independence comes from the fact that Java code is compiled into platform-independent bytecode, which can be interpreted and executed by the platform-dependent JVM. This design allows the same Java program to be run on any device, on any operating system, as long as a JVM is available for that system.
# what is "this." means and its purpose in class.
The above code is a Java program that defines a class called "lens" nested within another class (the main class). The "lens" class represents a camera lens and has several properties such as the lens company, focus, price, color, and whether it is a prime lens or not.

The code uses the "this" keyword to refer to the current instance of the class. It is used to differentiate between the instance variables of the class and the parameters of the constructor or other methods that have the same name.

In the constructor of the "lens" class, you can see that the constructor takes several parameters with the same names as the instance variables. The "this" keyword is used to assign the values of the constructor parameters to the corresponding instance variables of the class.

For example, when you create an instance of the "lens" class and call its constructor like this:

```java
lens myLens = new lens("Canon", "50mm", 500.0, "Black", true);
```

The values passed to the constructor parameters ("Canon", "50mm", 500.0, "Black", true) are assigned to the corresponding instance variables using the "this" keyword. So, `this.company = company` assigns the value of the constructor parameter "Canon" to the instance variable "company", `this.Focus = Focus` assigns the value of the constructor parameter "50mm" to the instance variable "Focus", and so on.

The "this" keyword is used to disambiguate between the local variables or parameters and the instance variables of the class when they have the same name. It allows you to refer to the instance variables within the class's methods or constructors.
